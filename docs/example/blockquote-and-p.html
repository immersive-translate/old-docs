              Once you’ve thanked and said goodbye to the items that do not
              spark joy, what can you do with them?

                Lately, I, a maximalist, have been yearning to be a minimalist.
                I am not alone. “People are stuck in their houses and sick of
                their stuff,” Randy Sabin, who runs estate and Internet sales,
                told me over the phone from Morris, Connecticut. “It’s staring
                them in the face. They have to dust it.” A survey conducted by
                the storage marketplace Neighbor found that quasi-house arrest
                has made seventy-eight per cent of respondents realize that they
                have more possessions than they need. What to do with this First
                World surplus? Your children don’t want it. The son of a friend,
                when offered his pick of items from his grandfather’s estate—an
                antique clock? an Emmy?—took a toilet plunger. In my apartment,
                it’s got so cluttered that sometimes, when I leave—usually to
                acquire more stuff—it crosses my mind that I should leave a
                “Dear Burglar” note, urging the intruder to help herself.

                A few months ago, I decided to deaccession an assortment of my
                things by whatever means feasible: selling, donating, recycling,
                giving them away, losing them on the subway, or reserving a spot
                for them on the next Mars Explorer. I gathered my unwanteds and
                piled them in the living room. A fraction of what was in that
                jumble: seven antique glass cake stands that belonged to my
                mother; a dormitory’s worth of new sheet sets and blankets for a
                bed size that is not mine; a set of Lenox china that my
                grandmother gave to my mother, who gave it to me, and was never
                used; clothes galore; a Viking stove grate that arrived cracked,
                and which I saved because I planned to weld it into a sculpture
                someday, after I learned how to weld; several rolls of Trump
                toilet paper that I wrongly thought were amusing a few years
                ago. I wish I could have added my boyfriend’s too large Le
                Corbusier lounger. (There are Web sites, such as
                NeverLikedItAnyway.com, that will buy your ex’s leavings,
                ranging from engagement rings to “Rick and Morty” socks.)

                Some will have you believe that the hardest part of parting with
                your belongings is choosing which items must go. Not so; saying
                goodbye is easy. Finding new homes for your stuff is the
                challenge. In December, a Brooklyn woman offered the entire
                contents of her closet (more than fifty pieces) to her online
                neighborhood network, much of it gratis. A month later, lots of
                her clothes were still available. Turns out people prefer cheap
                to free.

                If Melania Trump can auction off the big white hat she wore when
                she met the Macrons (plus a watercolor of her in the hat and an
                N.F.T. of that watercolor) for a hundred and seventy thousand
                dollars, don’t we all deserve a little something for our
                castoffs?
              </p>

                TIP No. 1: Life is not “Antiques Roadshow.” The thingies you
                found in your grandfather’s drawer after he died are his
                dentures, not a valuable Jurassic-age fossil.

                The first thing I tried to unload was four folk-art handbags,
                each constructed out of braided cigarette-pack wrappers by
                incarcerated Americans in the nineteen-fifties and sixties. I’d
                amassed the collection in the nineties, on eBay, for reasons
                that now elude me. I consulted with Stan Jennings, a retired
                postal worker, for guidance on selling them. Jennings has been
                selling goods on eBay and Etsy for clients since 1998. I asked
                him: Should I list the purses as a group or individually? If you
                offer them as a package deal, he explained, you’ll lose
                collectors, who prefer to cherry-pick; your likely buyer will be
                a dealer interested in reselling, and who therefore won’t offer
                much. Should I auction the purse or sell it at a fixed price?
                For unique, rare, or high-demand items, Jennings said, choose
                the former—and hope for a bidding war. If items are readily
                available, go for the latter, which allows impulsive buyers to
                snatch them at the click of a button. (According to Don Heiden,
                who runs the Auction Professor channel on YouTube, fixed-price
                “Buy It Now” items tend to fetch a higher price than those at
                auctions.) Any particular words one should use in the
                description? “Unique.” “Conversation piece.” “Smoke-free home.”
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>TIP No. 2: A good story can clinch a sale.</p>
              <p>
                Include the provenance and a heartwarming anecdote in your
                description. “This dried filbert nut,” you might say, “was
                Napoleon’s lucky charm. He carried the shell in his pocket
                during the Battle of Austerlitz and credits it with his
                victory.” Without that narrative, the nut is just a nut. As to
                why you are getting rid of this valuable heirloom, it behooves
                you to explain. Received one just like it last Arbor Day?
                Downsizing? Nut allergy?
              </p>
              <p>
                My “Vintage Tramp Art Cigarette Pack Wrapper purse prison
                inmates 1960’s” was put up on eBay (“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a piece of
                history&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”) for the site’s hundred and
                fifty-two million buyers for seventy-five dollars. I’d bought it
                for about that much. (Listing is free on eBay for your first two
                hundred and fifty items each month; the fee on sales for most
                categories is 12.55 per cent.) No offers. I added “Collectible”
                to the title and lowered the price to sixty-five dollars. Still
                no offers. I tried my luck on Etsy, a site that specializes in
                crafts, handmade jewelry, wedding accoutrements such as veils,
                vintage anything, and decorative stickers. If the TV show
                “Portlandia” were a Web site, it would be Etsy. (Twenty-cent
                listing fee; five-per-cent transaction charge.) No takers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I shifted my attention to the heaps of clothes that looked
                better on my couch than on me. There are plenty of eBay
                alternatives specializing in schmatta. Depop is the cool-kids’
                table in the cafeteria of e-commerce. Ninety per cent of the
                app’s users are twenty-five or younger, and the merchandise
                reflects this demographic: a goth corset bustier with boning
                (seventy-five dollars); a plush phone case in the shape of a
                panda (twenty-three dollars); rollerblades (twenty-two dollars
                and ninety-nine cents), with many items styled into ensembles.
                (Depop takes ten per cent of every item sold.) Poshmark,
                frequented by a slightly older buyer, sees itself as not merely
                a selling tool but also as a social stomping ground. Throughout
                the day, there are Posh Parties—virtual shopping events
                organized by sellers around certain themes: “Everything Petite
                Posh Party,” “Wow-Worthy Wardrobe Posh Party,” “Clothes I’m Now
                Too Fat to Wear” (I made that one up). During these virtual
                gatherings, members are encouraged to mingle. Here is some
                representative banter from a cosmetics Posh party: “😃👍Congrats
                on your HOST PICK!! I’m sharing with my followers and hope for a
                sale for
                you!!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;🤑💵💥CHA-CHING!!💥💵🤑
                💚❤️💙🧡💜💚❤️💙🧡💜💚❤️💙🧡💜 🥳🎉🎈🥳🎉🎈🥳🎉🎈🥳🎉🎈
                💚❤️💙🧡💜💚❤️” No thank you, Poshmark; all my friend slots are
                taken. (Twenty-per-cent commission for items over fifteen
                dollars.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Are you the type who still ventures outdoors? The most
                expeditious way to discover whether your whatnot is worth
                something or nothing is to visit an actual consignment shop in
                an actual building. Not long ago, I lugged a few bags to La
                Boutique Resale, an establishment that occupies the second and
                third floors of a brownstone on Madison Avenue. Frank Aquino, a
                co-owner, scrutinized each of my offerings with the intensity of
                an F.D.A. inspector checking a hamburger patty for E. coli: a
                fur hat was found to have a small but fatal stain on the
                grosgrain interior band; a pair of beige linen Manolo Blahniks
                lacked enough of what Aquino called the “wow” factor; the
                dominant color in a clutch bag—let’s call it Grey Poupon—was
                unappreciated. I took home a receipt for four items (two
                scarves, a Krizia tweed suit, and a stingray-skin evening bag;
                respectively, forty-nine and fifty-nine dollars, a hundred and
                fifty dollars, eighty dollars). I’ll receive half of whatever
                sells within ninety days.
              </p>
              <p>
                Closer to home—wherever you may live—you can sell your stuff to
                your neighbors via one of many online garage-sale platforms. I
                tried two of them—Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace. According
                to Jessa Lingel, the author of “An Internet for the People: The
                Politics and Promise of Craigslist,” they represent two
                different models of the shared economy. Craigslist has, by
                intention, remained a snapshot of the Internet from the
                nineties, a time when Web sites were less about making money
                than about fostering community. Craigslist has not gone public
                and has made only a small profit since its beginnings, compared
                with Facebook, which made eighty-six billion dollars in 2020,
                the vast majority in targeted ads. When you get rid of a couch
                on Craigslist, you are getting rid of a couch; when you get rid
                of a couch on Facebook, you may be saying goodbye to your data,
                too.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                I listed thirteen items on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist,
                and sold seven. Here’s what I learned: When it’s cold out, cozy
                bed linens sell like hotcakes. The transactions were speedy, and
                there were no commissions and no shipping fees, since the lucky
                winners pick up their acquisitions at a mutually convenient
                spot—for instance, the lobby of my apartment building. A nurse
                from Queens sent me a photograph of my erstwhile bowl displayed
                on her shelf, and the woman who came for the microfibre sheet
                set followed up with a thank-you message that included details
                of her sister’s weight-loss journey. It is the closest an adult
                can come to having a lemonade stand.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the other hand, you’d probably make more money per hour by
                babysitting. My niece set out to sell a bunch of things that
                she’d used at her wedding. She started by listing a water
                cooler—original price twenty-five dollars—on Facebook
                Marketplace. “I received ten-plus inquiries, but many turned out
                to be no-shows and others tried to haggle,” she told me. “One
                guy asked, ‘Can you do it for seven?’ I had to coördinate a
                pickup time and place, and arrange for payment, and it was a
                huge hassle. I ended up deciding to give everything else away
                because it felt like way too much work for seven dollars.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The gift economy—a system whereby goods are not sold but given
                away—has been around for as long as we’ve had things. Native
                Americans from the Northwest Pacific Coast held potlatch feasts
                at which property and goods were lavished upon neighboring
                tribes, mainly for the purpose of showing off wealth. Today,
                among the seventy per cent of respondents who said they got rid
                of stuff during quarantine, the majority donated them, according
                to Neighbor, a site billed as “the Airbnb of storage,” which
                enables you to rent space in neighbors’ houses to store your
                junk. (Who are these people with extra closets? I hate them.)
                The reasons for donating are manifold, ranging from the goodness
                of your heart to the goodness of a tax writeoff.

                Let’s start with Freecycle and the Buy Nothing Project, two
                worldwide social networks (more than nine million and five
                million members, respectively) that operate on the local level,
                where members give away items they no longer want and request
                others that they are looking for. If you like extremely short
                stories, the entries on both these apps are rich with drama:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    “My mother-in-law insisted I needed these jewelry boxes, but
                    I really don’t. Do you?”
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    “Spray starch, typically used for Men’s shirts. Feels full.
                    I think this might be left over from a former relationship.
                    It should also move on.”
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    “We were totally unprepared for the possibility of our baby

                    deal)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . If anyone has preemie
                    clothing/items they no longer need to help carry us the next
                    few weeks to when she’s hopefully grown enough to fit into
                    what we have, I would be so grateful.”

                    TIP No. 3: If you want to give away an assortment of things
                    online, stipulate that the winner takes all. Otherwise,
                    someone will cherry-pick the Makita cordless drill and leave
                    you with the rusty files, mauve bed skirt, and avocado
                    slicer.

                    Nobody on Craigslist, I discovered, cared to pay five
                    dollars for three rolls of Trump toilet paper, still in the
                    package. Over on Freecycle, there were seven requests within
                    two days of my posting, plus one inquiry about whether I had
                    any Biden toilet paper. A number of Buy Nothing members were
                    interested in my good-as-new copy of “The Intelligent
                    Person’s Guide to Giving in New York City: How to Donate or
                    Recycle Everything,” by Lynn Savarese, published twelve
                    years ago.

                    The etiquette governing whom to select among multiple
                    suitors is discussed with Talmudic rigor on Buy Nothing
                    message boards. Some favor letting the offer “simmer” (a Buy
                    Nothing term), so that you have an opportunity to spend
                    quality online time conversing with more neighbors. Others
                    allow a Web site called Wheel of Names to randomly choose a
                    winner. Then, there are those who ask would-be recipients to
                    describe how they plan to use your gift, so that you can
                    pick the most compelling story. Bear in mind that the object
                    under discussion could, for example, be a partially consumed
                    tub of cheese balls.

                    For those who would like to give less interactively and more
                    anonymously, there are innumerable worthy charities.
                    Goodwill was founded in 1902 by a Boston minister who
                    collected goods from the rich, hired the poor to mend them,
                    and then either sold them back to the rich or gave them to
                    the poor. Today, Goodwill has more than three thousand
                    stores across the country. Most of them are willing to take
                    just about anything you’d give to a friend. The Free Store
                    Project will accept most things except furniture, and you’re
                    welcome to permanently borrow what’s there. (“Take what you
                    need. Give when you can” is the slogan of this place; open
                    24/7; more than a dozen locations, across Manhattan, Queens,
                    and Brooklyn.) There are lots of other obscure, specialized
                    organizations. For instance, all those old, unusable mascara
                    wands in your bathroom cabinet? Mail them to Wands for
                    Wildlife, a nonprofit that started off as a program at the
                    Appalachian Wildlife Refuge, in North Carolina. These will
                    be shared with wildlife caretakers to comb away fly eggs,
                    dirt, fleas, ticks, and larvae from the wings of birds and
                    the fur of animals (wandsforwildlife.org). Fur coat? It is
                    said that nobody wants fur these days, but animals do.
                    Rehabilitators, like those at Sacred Friends, in Norfolk,
                    Virginia, cut up old coats and use the scraps as little
                    capes and stoles to keep sick animals warm
                    (1sthawksnest@gmail.com). PETA wants your pelts, too. The
                    organization donates them to the homeless (“the only humans
                    with any excuse to wear fur,” according to its Web site),
                    and lately it has shipped fur garments to Afghanistan and
                    Iraq for use by refugees.

                    Your old bras are welcomed with open arms at the Bra
                    Recyclers, a Phoenix-based enterprise that has sent more
                    than four million bras to homeless shelters, schools, foster
                    programs, and other nonprofits all over the world. As Elaine
                    Birks-Mitchell, the founder of the Bra Recyclers, explained
                    to me over Zoom, bras are not just about fashion. For girls
                    in developing countries, they make it possible to play
                    sports and attend school without embarrassment.

                    What to do with your nine-foot-tall resin giraffe? The
                    people at Burberry donate theirs, along with a couple of
                    gorillas and some toucans (all are retired store displays)
                    to Materials for the Arts—the largest creative-reuse center
                    in New York City. The goal of the center, founded in 1978,
                    is to provide art supplies to schools and creative types in
                    underserved communities. Feel free to visit the
                    organization’s thirty-five-thousand-square-foot warehouse in
                    Long Island City to drop off your buttons and beads and
                    bric-a-brac, where they will join an array of Winsor &amp;
                    Newton markers, jars from makeup manufacturers, Flavor Paper
                    wallpaper, artificial Christmas trees, orange jumpsuits from
                    “Orange Is the New Black,” office chairs from Bloomberg—and,
                    soon, the broken grate from my Viking stove.

                    Another good place to donate: the sidewalks of New York and
                    many other cities function as smorgasbords of secondhand
                    goods. A sofa that I couldn’t give away online was snagged
                    an hour after I left it at the curb. The Instagram account
                    StoopingNYC photographically chronicles what’s up for grabs
                    on the streets in all five boroughs. No mattresses, though,
                    since every city dweller fears bedbugs more than the Delta
                    variant.

                    In the New York area, Renewable Recycling will pick up your
                    mattress for a modest fee and repurpose its components,
                    turning the padding into cushion fillings, the springs into
                    appliances, and the wood frames into mulch. To find a taker
                    or hauler near you, consult the listings on
                    ByeByeMattress.com and Earth911.com. If you have too many
                    corks from wine bottles lying around, maybe recycling isn’t
                    your biggest problem. Nevertheless, two companies, ReCORK
                    and the Cork Forest Conservation Alliance, will take your
                    bottle stoppers, and make sure they find an afterlife in
                    shoes, fishing tackle, model-train tracks, and more.

                    Electronics deserves its own paragraph, given that e-waste
                    is “the fastest growing waste stream in the world,”
                    according to the World Economic Forum. Always looking out
                    for herself, Alexa informs me that it’s illegal to throw out
                    electronics in many states. Yet more than fifty million tons
                    of the stuff is produced every year and only twenty per cent
                    of it is formally recycled. (If you like to measure
                    everything in Eiffel Towers, that’s the equivalent of about
                    five thousand of them.) Better to give your old tech items
                    to Computers with Causes, which passes them on to people and
                    organizations that need them, or to World Computer Exchange,
                    an organization that refurbishes computers and then donates
                    them to schools, libraries, community centers, and hospitals
                    in developing countries (computerswithcauses.org;
                    worldcomputerexchange.org). If you’d rather sell your
                    devices, Decluttr will give you cash; Amazon’s trade-in
                    program will compensate you in Amazon gift cards; and
                    SellCell compares more than forty buyback companies so that
                    you can get the most cash for your cell phone.

                    Finally we come to the heavy, bulky crapola, especially
                    furniture, that is prohibitively expensive to ship, and not
                    much fun to drag to a thrift shop. Most of it arrived in
                    trucks and, I am happy to report, some of it can be taken
                    away in trucks. There are many junk-removal services
                    (1-800-Got-Junk?, Junk King, College HUNKS Hauling Junk
                    &amp; Moving), but I’m partial to the Junkluggers, because
                    once it showed up with two trucks and swooped up mountains
                    of castoffs (including a parking meter) from my boyfriend’s
                    storage unit; so far, the junk has never come back. (It
                    charges around nine hundred to a thousand dollars to remove
                    a truckful in the New York area.) Moreover, the organization
                    tries its darndest to donate your junk to charity and give
                    you a tax-deductible receipt. GreenDrop, which may sound
                    like a square on the Candy Land board, is a donation
                    dropoff-and-pickup service that serves the East Coast. You
                    can designate which of the handful of charities it partners
                    with you’d like your flotsam and jetsam delivered to. The
                    organization accepts kitchenware, games, books, and small
                    appliances and furniture. If you live somewhere outside the
                    GreenDrop domain, you can consult the directory on the
                    Donation Town Web site which suggests charities nationwide
                    that pick up in or nearest your Zip Code (Donationtown.org).
                    Other organizations that just might come for your stuff
                    include Habitat for Humanity ReStores (home goods, including
                    air-conditioners); and Pickup Please (easy-to-arrange
                    scheduling and pickups, usually within twenty-four hours of
                    request; helps American veterans).

                    Schedule permitting, volunteers at the House of Good Deeds,
                    in New York City, will pick up whatever you have to give, in
                    its graffiti-covered van or school bus. The aims of this
                    nonprofit are to help those in need and to keep as much as
                    possible out of landfills. The charity was started, in 2017,
                    by Leon Feingold and his fiancée, Yuanyuan Wang, who was
                    given a diagnosis of terminal endometrial cancer a few days
                    after the couple became engaged. They were so moved by the
                    kindness of strangers and friends, who, responding to a
                    social-media post, helped not only with medical bills but
                    also with all the wedding costs, that Feingold and Wang
                    created the House of Good Deeds. Wang died shortly after the
                    wedding, but the charity has flourished. Since its founding,
                    there have been regular giveaway events, at which everyone
                    is encouraged to take whatever he or she desires rather than
                    leaving it for a hypothetical person who might need it more,
                    and then to reciprocate the gesture later. “Let’s say Bill
                    Gates saw a belt buckle he liked,” Feingold told me over the
                    phone. “We’d want him to take it and pay it forward.” Has
                    Gates ever come to an event? “Not yet, but he’s welcome to
                    the belt buckle.” Donations can be dropped off 24/7 at the
                    House of Good Deeds office, which is also Feingold’s
                    apartment. If Feingold is away or asleep, you can leave them
                    with the doorman (1 River Place, Suite 1406, New York, New
                    York; 917-325-4548).

                    People divesting themselves of quantities of books (and this
                    applies to LPs, too) often start by thinking, Oh, boy, I’m
                    going to make so much money selling these precious volumes!,
                    and end up saying, “I will pay you any amount of money to
                    take this shit off my hands.” A friend who specializes in
                    rare books at a big auction house told me, “I get calls all
                    the time from people who say, ‘I have four thousand books,
                    and I think they’re valuable.’ My first thought is: No,
                    they’re not. Usually, if a collection is valuable someone
                    knows.” To determine how much a single book will go for (not
                    what you’ll get for it), check the price of similar books on
                    a site, such as AbeBooks, Alibris, or Biblio. If you have a
                    huge library, Michael Pyron, a bookbinder and bookseller in
                    Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, suggests putting together a
                    representative box and taking it to a bookseller, who can
                    then decide whether your collection warrants a house call.
                    The Strand, in Manhattan, will accept walk-ins of up to
                    forty books and will give you cash. (If you’d prefer store
                    credit, you’ll earn fifty per cent more.) As to what types
                    of books are accepted, Billy Mowbray, who co-manages the
                    buying desk, e-mailed to say that “a good guideline for most
                    subjects is going to be titles which are considered classics
                    or those published within the past year.”

                    Nor is the worth of a book necessarily enhanced by its being
                    a first edition. The first printing of the first London
                    edition of the first Harry Potter book is “stupidly
                    expensive” (one sold for around $471,000), Pyron said,
                    explaining that not many copies were printed because no one
                    expected that it would become the Pet Rock of the publishing
                    business. First editions late in a series can go for less
                    than the cost of postage. The same supply-and-demand
                    reckoning applies to signed copies. Hemingway? Yes. Updike?
                    Not so much. It turns out he signed so many books that it’s
                    a mystery how he found time to write any.

                    “For me, the threshold is a book I can put a price of
                    twenty-five dollars or above on,” Pyron told me. “If a
                    dealer is offering you a dollar a book, it’s not worth
                    shopping around,” he said. “If someone offers you a hundred
                    and fifty dollars for a book, it might be worth getting
                    another opinion.”

                    It’s probably time to throw your remaining books
                    overboard—but throw them where they’ll matter. For instance,
                    prison libraries
                    (libguides.ala.org/PrisonLibraries/bookstoprisons); Books

                    The desperate go to the dump, which seems like a
                    not-trying-too-hard euphemism for the landfill. What we used
                    to call a dump—ripe rubbage, rats, l’eau du rotten egg—has
                    been illegal since 1976. The dump has been replaced by the
                    transfer station, strictly regulated sites that operate as
                    temporary repositories until the refuse can be transported
                    to landfills. If landfills are the Las Vegas of waste
                    management (what goes there stays there), recycling and
                    transfer stations are communist utopias where givers are
                    encouraged to be takers, too. Need some Christmas
                    decorations, side tables, the contents of an old lady’s
                    scarf drawer, perfectly good books, mulch?

                    As you surely have heard, the younger generations have no
                    interest in inheriting the loot amassed by their
                    materialistic baby-boomer parents. Silver, crystal, fondue
                    sets, Ethan Allen hutches—they want none of it. Why are they
                    looking gift horses in the mouth? A young friend tried to
                    explain. “Our generation wants to feel like we’re in a space
                    that we put together and designed ourselves, not a microcosm
                    of our parents’ house,” he said.“Since so many of us were
                    largely financially dependent on our parents into our early
                    twenties, we want to feel like we built some aspect of our
                    lives without help.”

                    sharing six hundred square feet of space, “which involves a
                    very defined stuff limit.” She added, “Also, I think our
                    generation doesn’t have the expectation of owning a home or
                    living in a much larger space, so we learn to buy things
                    that we need and have space for, rather than accumulating a
                    bunch of junk that will fit into some larger home that we’ll
                    live in someday.” A friend’s twenty-eight-year-old son
                    offered the most philosophical explanation. “Maybe we buy as
                    much stuff as any other generation, but much of it is
                    digital—in-app purchases or memberships or things to be
                    stored in the cloud,” he said. “This allows us the illusion
                    of being minimalist. We’ve substituted spiritual clutter for
                    stacks of paper.”

                    TIP No. 5: A major perk of death is that you don’t have to
                    clean up after yourself. If you can’t muster the courage to
                    deal with your three storage units, leave the contents to
                    your heirs. Mention in the will that there’s something
                    valuable in one of them.&nbsp;♦
