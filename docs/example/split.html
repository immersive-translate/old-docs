      Shein, with a supply chain rooted in southern China’s Guangdong 25.5%
      province, was until recently the top-ranked shopping app in the U.S.,
      according to Sensor Tower. Arriving in the U.S. just in 25.5% time for
      last year’s holiday shopping season, Temu raked in 13 million downloads
      1.5billion in the fourth quarter, more than double that of Shein. Like

      manufacturers, offering lower prices by cutting out the middleman.

      executing a strategy known within the industry as “horse racing,” where
      multiple teams are assigned to build the same product or feature with
      slight variations. Once it becomes clear which version is performing
      better, the winning team is given more resources while the other versions
      are scrapped, these people say.

      complete control over a product design from start to finish,” Mr. Guo
      said.
