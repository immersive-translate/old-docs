        Prosecutors for the U.S. Department of Justice’s Southern District of
        New York unsealed a criminal indictment on Tuesday charging Mr.
        Bankman-Fried with lying to investors from the start of the company. Mr.
        Bankman-Fried faces eight counts, including wire fraud on customers and
        lenders, and conspiring to defraud the United States and violate
        campaign finance laws. “This is our first public announcement, but it
        will not be our last,” Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the
        Southern District, said at a news conference about the charges. The
        Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges on Tuesday
        alleging that Mr. Bankman-Fried misled investors who committed nearly $2
        billion to FTX while also defrauding customers of the exchange. The
        Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which plays an important role in
        overseeing the crypto industry, also filed a complaint against Mr.
        Bankman-Fried, charging him with fraud and misrepresentation. Mr.
        Bankman-Fried was arrested shortly after 6 p.m. on Monday at his
        apartment complex, according to a statement from the Bahamian police.
        The timing of when Mr. Bankman-Fried might be moved to the United States
        was unclear. The Bahamas has an extradition treaty with the United
        States, but the process can take weeks, and sometimes far longer if a
        criminal defendant contests it. Mr. Bankman-Fried was denied bail by a
        judge in the Bahamas on Tuesday. The House Committee on Financial
        Services held a hearing about FTX’s collapse. Mr. Bankman-Fried was
        slated to testify, but the hearing went ahead without him, featuring
        testimony from John J. Ray III, who took over FTX after its bankruptcy.
        Mr. Ray spent nearly four hours answering questions about what caused
        FTX’s implosion. It was a case of “old-fashioned embezzlement,” he said.
