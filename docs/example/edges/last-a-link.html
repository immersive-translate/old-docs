          >Before I would go, I would find somebody to write me a letter of
          recommendation. I’d knock on Mr. Boland’s door and I’d hand it to him.
          And he’d say “Jason, do we have an appointment? Are you on my
          schedule?” And I’d say, “No, I’m here for the tae kwon do class. I
          wanted to give you this letter of recommendation. And I thought you
          should see my second quarter grades” . . . Mr. Boland calls and says,
          “I’m going to Yale . . . But as I was leaving, they asked me if I had
          any requests as to how they could do things better. And I said I
          thought they should accept the most nontraditional student for the
          1988 year . . . You.”<sup><a href="#ch2fn_5">5</a></sup></i
