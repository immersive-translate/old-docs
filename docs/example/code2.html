        This double loading could occur since a <code>.css</code> file will be
        emitted and it's likely that the CSS string will also be used by the
        application code â€” for example, injected by the framework runtime. From
        Vite 4, the <code>.css</code> default export
        <a
          href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/11094"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
          >has been deprecated</a
        >. The <code>?inline</code> query suffix modifier needs to be used in
        this case, as that doesn't emit the imported <code>.css</code> styles.
