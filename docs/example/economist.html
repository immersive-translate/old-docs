      Derby, the most famous horse race in America, will head to Churchill Downs
      racetrack on May 6th to watch 20 horses “run for the roses” (a reference
      to the blanket of flowers given to the winner). They may place a dollar or
      two on Forte, the 3-1 favourite. They will sip mint juleps and sing “My
      Old Kentucky Home”, clad in finery that will include hats to rival those
      worn at King Charles’s coronation. Away from the track many others will
      attend Derby parties to watch the “the greatest two minutes in sports”.
      Last year’s race was <small>NBC</small>’s most watched programme since the
      Super Bowl three months earlier. One could be forgiven for assuming the
      spectacle means that horse racing in America is thriving. It is not.
